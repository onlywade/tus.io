    <div class="post-content">
  <p>As time progresses, we share ever larger media files from our phones and desktops. More than often, however, complications arise during this process. Whether it is through servers misbehaving or mobile users switching to a WiFi connection, the outcome is the same: ‘upload interrupted’.</p>

<p>This is by itself a negative user experience, but it becomes even worse when it happens in the middle of a 2GB upload on a slow connection. And of course, the longer an upload takes, the more exposed it is to poor connections. A failed upload will then have to be retried from the start, if the user even bothers with it at all.</p>

<p>With media files growing larger and networks remaining fragile, it is clear that we need a better solution to handle uploading.</p>

<h3 id="resumable-uploads">Resumable Uploads</h3>

<p>Even though certain decent network libraries already implement retries, these do not give the option to resume at the point where the upload was previously interrupted and then only transfer the remaining bytes. Furthermore, these network libraries often require additional user input in order to retry failed uploads. If retries were initiated behind the scenes, the user might not even notice he had an interrupted connection, as the total duration of the upload would barely be impacted.</p>

<p>There are also many areas in the world where connections are quite poor. In such places, restarting an upload from the beginning usually means that the user only gets to transmit the first 20% of his file, before the connection breaks again. Thus, resuming an upload exactly where it left off is the <em>only</em> way a large file will ever be uploaded in these cases.</p>

<p>From this, it is apparent that we <em>need</em> resumable uploads and therefore we are proud to present tus, the protocol that aims to offer solutions to all of the problems listed above.</p>

<p>In addition to this, tus has redesigned the process of uploading in such a way that multiple file parts can be sent simultaneously. Using tus not only makes uploading a lot more reliable, but also much faster.</p>

<h3 id="havent-other-companies-already-implemented-this">Haven’t other companies already implemented this?</h3>

<p>Yes, but we see this as another part of the problem. While there are many implementations that offer resumable uploads, they all solve it in a different way. They are either bound to one language or use case. They are also not as thorough or interoperable as we would like, because they all speak different dialects. Some implementations are supported by others, but that is as far as compatibility goes.</p>

<p>This is not remotely how an <em>open web</em> should work.</p>

<p>Dropbox, Vimeo, Google and AWS all have their own API’s for uploading chunks. Some companies describe their API, but make choices that aren’t suitable for general use and they certainly don’t offer a platform to contribute improvements. If we want to support anything beyond their use case, we are on our own again. This further increases fragmentation and leaves resumable file uploads as a luxury, only to be enjoyed by a few large companies, while it should be the standard method that benefits everyone.</p>

<h3 id="tus">tus</h3>

<p>tus is a protocol that is fully community-owned. It has been <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol">developed</a> using nothing but GitHub and Markdown, and was fueled by a profound motivation - shared by a few passionate high profile developers - to solve this problem once and for all.</p>

<p>Over the course of two years, we have received suggestions from people working at
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues?q=mentions%3Avayam">Vimeo</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues?q=mentions%3Atechnoweenie">GitHub</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues?q=mentions%3ABaughn">Google</a>,
and from the author of
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus.io/issues?q=mentions%3Ahintjens">ØMQ</a>, as well as from the co-authors of
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues?q=mentions%3Areschke">HTTP/1.1</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues?q=mentions%3Afelixge">Node.js</a>.</p>

<p>It has not always been easy to find consensus and at times we hit deadlocks. In the past few months, however, we have made considerable progress and we are now excited to announce a finalized version 1.0. tus is ready for the world to use.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>

<p>Let’s take a quick look at an example of a simple communication between a client and a server speaking tus 1.0:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Client:
&gt; POST /files HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: tus.example.org
&gt; Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
&gt; Content-Length: 0
&gt; Upload-Length: 100
&gt; Upload-Metadata: filename d29ybGRfZG9taW5hdGlvbl9wbGFuLnBkZg==

# Server:
&lt; HTTP/1.1 201 Created
&lt; Location: http://tus.example.org/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
&lt; Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0

# Client:
&gt; PATCH /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: tus.example.org
&lt; Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
&gt; Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream
&gt; Content-Length: 30
&gt; Upload-Offset: 0
&gt;
&gt; [first 30 bytes]

# Server:
&lt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
&lt; Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>Since tus is a layer on top of HTTP, it is easy to reason about, inspect, extend and deploy in existing projects as well as infra.</p>

<h3 id="a-streamlined-core-with-optional-extensions">A streamlined core with optional extensions</h3>

<p>The core of the protocol is lightweight, yet well documented and it defines the way in which communication should take place. In addition to this, tus offers extensions such as Checksum, Expiration and Concatenation, which support different use cases and are opt-in.</p>

<p>To highlight one of the protocol’s extensions: Concatenation allows you to split a 100GB file in 20 parts of 5GB, upload them in parallel, and uses the tus server to stitch them together again. This makes uploads much faster by utilizing the available bandwidth more efficiently. An extra advantage of this method is that individual chunks are considered regular tus uploads, which benefit from all of tus’ features (retries, checksums, etc.).</p>

<h3 id="implementations">Implementations</h3>

<p>Our aim is to support all major languages and platforms. Alongside the protocol
we also develop many implementations, so that developers can have drop-in self-hosted resumable
file uploads at zero cost.</p>

<p>We currently support the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">Server in Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server">Server in ES2015 JavaScript for Node.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client">Client in JavaScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/TUSKit">Client for iOS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-android-client">Client for Android</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-java-client">Client in Java</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, there are many community provided <a href="http://www.tus.io/implementations.html">implementations</a> in languages such as:
<a href="https://github.com/picocandy/rubytus">Ruby</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/vayam/tuspy">Python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/leblanc-simon/php-tus">PHP</a>.</p>

<p>Quality implementations of the protocol licensed MIT might be adopted in the <a href="https://github.com/tus">tus organization on GitHub</a>, making you an official contributor to the project.</p>

<h3 id="releasing-version-10">Releasing version 1.0</h3>

<p>Today we are proud to announce that we have launched version 1.0 on GitHub by merging <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/57">the 1.0 pull request</a>.</p>

<p>We consider the protocol to be stable and ready for production!</p>

<p>The full protocol is published online <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-adopters">Early Adopters</h3>

<p>Early adopters <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> and Transloadit have already announced they will use tus 1.0 as their main protocol for uploading.</p>

<p>tus is initiated and funded by <a href="https://transloadit.com">Transloadit</a>, but it is community owned and this will never change.</p>

<p>We encourage anybody who deals with file uploads to have have a look at tus and to consider using it for your next release.</p>

<h3 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h3>

<p>It has taken us the better part of three years and we have had to overcome many obstacles along the way. It is in great part thanks to <a href="/about.html">these people</a> that tus is able to push out a stable release today. A special 
word of thanks goes out to the talented people that have been instrumental in getting us to where we are today: <a href="https://felixge.com">Felix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vayam">Naren</a> and <a href="https://transloadit.com/about#marius">Marius</a>. We couldn’t have done tus without you!</p>

  <p>Here’s a quick update on the status of the project.</p>

<h3 id="section">1.0</h3>

<p>We’re finalizing 1.0. Our project
lead <a href="https://github.com/Acconut">Marius Kleidl</a> has been taking care
of integrating a large batch of improvements
that were made by Vimeo’s <a href="https://github.com/vayam">Naren Venkataraman</a> and this team.</p>

<p>Things still left to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues/59">Write a Developers Guide</a></li>
  <li>Gather a <em>final round of feedback</em> on <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/57">the 1.0 proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re waiting for a <em>final round of feedback</em> to make sure every last bit
is taken care of before cementing everything into our first stable release.</p>

<h3 id="exposure--swag">Exposure &amp; Swag</h3>

<p>To make sure every developer and interested party had their change to chime in,
we’re trying to get some extra exposure for the project. We’ll be covered
in the upcoming <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a> and Transloadit
is sponsoring conferences to hand out swag and raise tus awareness.</p>

<p>Swag is also for sale at the new <a href="http://shop.tus.io/collections/all">shop.tus.io</a>. The shop
currently only features two, pretty expensive, items and we’re working with <a href="https://www.theprintful.com/">Printful</a> to improve on that.
Know that any profit flows back to the project and our books are open to
anyone who wants to verify.</p>

<h3 id="implementations">Implementations</h3>

<p>While 1.0 could potentially still be changed, we don’t expect major changes
so our official implementations have already been made 1.0 compatible.</p>

<p>All official projects have been updated to the 1.0 branch already
for which a big thank you goes out to <a href="https://github.com/MMasterson">Mark R. Masterson</a>
and Marius who upgraded all of our implementations.</p>

<p>Marius also added Android and
standalone Java implementations as official tus projects, and replaced our jQuery
implementation with a standalone <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client">tus-js-client</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in building &amp; maintaining new 1.0 implementations, becoming
a member of tus core, leave a note here:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>The whole site has been given a new layout by <a href="https://github.com/fahad19">Fahad Ibnay Heylaal</a> and
a completely new logo was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/milan_vuckovic">Milan Vuckovic</a>.</p>

<p>We’re currently working on improving other:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="demo">Demo</h3>

<p>Since the first publication of the tus protocol, our website featured a
<a href="/demo.html">demo page</a> allowing users to see a tus in action, interactively.
In the past this service had some issues with reliability and browser-support.
Because of this past, we updated the entire stack used by the demo.</p>

<p>It now uses our newly created <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client">tus-js-client</a>
and we’ve updated the demo page to feature all the browsers &amp; platforms the
client has been tested to work on.
The demo page uploads files to a <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">tusd 1.0</a>
server written in Go, that we deploy via the newly created
<a href="https://github.com/tus/infra-tusd">infra-tusd</a> repository.</p>

<h3 id="infra">Infra</h3>

<p>Still a work in progress, <a href="https://github.com/tus/infra-tusd">infra-tusd</a>
uses a powerful combination of <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> and
<a href="https://terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to
spin up fully functioning tus servers with a single command. Every bit
(except for the AWS &amp; SSH keys) has been added to the repository
and is publicly available.</p>

<p>Please each out if you’d like to help us:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tus/infra-tusd/issues/1">Add local Vagrant support for testing the Ansible scripts</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>

<p>Finally, a few big companies have taken an interest
in tus. tus will always remain open source and community owned, but
we’re excited that we’re on the path to realizing our mission to
change how the world does file uploading.</p>

<p>We’ll have more announcements on this soon!</p>

<p>If you (plan to) use tus in production, please comment on this issue and get your
company listed on the tus.io website:</p>

  <p>More than a year ago the last release, <code>0.2.2</code> was published. Now the final 1.0
release is just around the corner introducing breaking changes and a lot of new
features.</p>

<p>The major changes towards the core include the addition of the <code>TUS-Resumable</code>,
<code>TUS-Max-Size</code>, <code>TUS-Extension</code> and <code>TUS-Version</code> headers while making the first
one mandatory. All these headers must be returned in the new <code>OPTIONS</code> request
in order to enable protocol discovery. In addition the <code>Offset</code> header must not
be greater or lower than the current offset for the file.</p>

<p>The biggest changes were made by introducing the Upload-Expiration,  Checksum,
Stream, Retries, Termination, Merge and Metadata extensions.</p>

<p>After all of this work the protocol is now considered stable and ready for use
in production environments. Speaking of implementations the official
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-jquery-client/tree/1.0"><code>tus-jquery-client</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd/tree/neXT"><code>tusd</code></a> repositories are currently being
updated to support the 1.0 release.</p>

<p>The final 1.0 Release will be published by merging the
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/57">according pull request</a>
on GitHub once these changes are done. Furthermore, last feedback may be
submitted there to adjust minor things.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
  <p>After releasing our first draft a few weeks ago, we received an incredible
amount of feedback and suggestions. Based on this feedback as well as
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013AprJun/0155.html">discussing</a>
the problems with the <a href="http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki">IETF HTTPbis Working
Group</a>, we identified a few
key issues with <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/blob/v0.1/README.md">v0.1</a> of the
protocol:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>PUT</code> requests are not appropiate for transfering partial resources</li>
  <li>The <code>Content-Range</code> and <code>Range</code> headers are not meant for resuming an
interrupted resource transfer.</li>
</ul>

<p>After lots of careful thinking, we came up with a new approach that uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>PATCH</code> instead of <code>PUT</code></li>
  <li>A new <code>Offset</code> header used by <code>HEAD</code> responses and <code>PATCH</code> requests alike</li>
  <li>A <code>Final-Length</code> header to provide the final file size to the server</li>
</ul>

<p>We also split the protocol into a core protocol which takes care of
resumability, and nothing else, as well as optional protocol extensions.</p>

<p>The result of this has just been published as v0.2 can be seen on the <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">protocol
page</a>. Also included is a new <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html#7">FAQ
section</a> which will expanded over time.</p>

<p>We feel that the overall result is a drastic simplification of the problem down
to its essence, and we encourage interested developers to implement prototypes.</p>

<p>Our next step is upgrading tusd, the jquery client and the ios client to the
new protocol version. Once the protocol has reached a little more maturity, we
are also thinking about providing an executable protocol verification tool for
implementers.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We are happy to announce version 0.1 of the <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">tus resumable upload
protocol</a> and are interested in your
feedback!</p>

<p>With mobile devices becoming the dominant source of user generated media files,
reliable file uploading through unreliable mobile networks has become an
important issue for anybody interested in content acquisition.</p>

<p>Reliability here means the ability to detect network errors, and resuming an
upload without having to start from the beginning. In many scenarios this can
mean the difference between a file reaching your application, or the user
giving up in frustration.</p>

<p>Ideally, this should be a trivial feature to add. In reality however, there is
quite a lack of solutions in this space. Sure, there are a few JavaScript
libraries that claim to support resumable uploading, but in reality you will
end up spending a lot of time coming up with your own API for it, or
implementing a poorly specified one specific to a library. This is incredibly
frustrating, especially if you are planning to support this feature on multiple
platforms such as HTML5, iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re a big company like Google, you may sit down and create such a
protocol for your needs. And in fact, Google has been working on a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears/wiki/ResumableHttpRequestsProposal">such a
protocol</a>
since 2010, for the now defunct Google Gears. The latest incarnation of this
are two incompatible protocols for <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/manage-uploads">Google
Drive</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol">YouTube</a>.
But unfortunately both of these protocols rely on a non-standard http status
code (<code>308 Resume Incomplete</code>), and are far from being generic enough for
general adoption.</p>

<p>This means that smaller companies are currently doomed to invent, implement and
maintain their own incompatible protocols and solutions for something that
should be a trivial component of a modern application.</p>

<p>We find this unacceptable, so the <a href="http://www.tus.io/">tus project</a> is a
community project that was born in order to level the playing field and make
resumable file uploading easy for anybody to implement.</p>

<p>Today we are happy to release version 0.1 of <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">our
protocol</a>. Interested developers are
encouraged to experiment with it, and we are very interested in any feedback
you may have.</p>

<p>Later this week we will also release some initial clients for
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-jquery-client">jQuery</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tus/TUSKit">iOS</a>, so make sure to follow this blog
and these repositories for future updates!</p>
